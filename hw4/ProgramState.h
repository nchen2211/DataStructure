// ProgramState.h
//
// CS 104 / Spring 2016
//
// The ProgramState class encapsulates the state of an executing Facile
// program.  The state of a Facile program consists of three parts:
//
//    * The program counter, which specifies the line number of the
//      statement that will execute next.
//    * A map, as explained by the problem writeup.
//    * A stack of integers, which is used to hold return lines for GOSUB
//      statements.
//
// I've provided you a start on this class, but you'll need to add methods
// to it as you go along.  In particular, you'll need methods to access and
// modify the state; these methods will be called primarily by the various
// execute() methods in the Statement subclasses, to allow the execution of
// a statement to change the state of a program.  For example, executing a
// GOTO statement will cause the program counter to be changed.
