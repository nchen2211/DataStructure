Problem 2 -- it was written on Problem2.txt

Problem 3 -- llist.h is stored under lib directory.
             llist.cpp is stored under src directory.
             g-test for problem 3 is on test.cpp.
             
             How to compile: 
             1. change the directory to hw_chrysill/hw3/Question3
             2. type command: make llisttest
             
Problem 4 -- llist.h, stackint.h are stored under lib directory.
             llist.cpp, stackint.cpp are stored under src directory.
             There is a makefile I created to test all the functions,
             main.cpp was the file I created (but didn't commit) to test
             all the functions
             
             How to compile: 
             1. change the directory to hw_chrysill/hw3/Question4
             2. change line 7 (main.cpp) to a testfile you are using to test
                the program
             3. type command: make
             4. type command: ./exe/hw3q4
             
Problem 5:  llist.h, stackint.h are stored under lib directory.
            llist.cpp, stackint.cpp are stored under src directory.
            hw3q5_main.cpp contains the main() function
            
            
            How to compile: 
            1. change the directory to hw_chrysill/hw3/Question5
            2. create the .txt file for the input
            3. type command: make
            4. type command: .exe/hw3q5 [.txt input file name]
